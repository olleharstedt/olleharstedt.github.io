Why can't the customers write their own damn reports. Or the sales people. Or the technical support. They already know some basic SQL, right? How hard could it be to reate a safe subset of SQL, that also includes some HTML formatting capability? But the parser would have to be dirt simple. I don't want to en dup with a big pil eof code only I can maintain. Kind kind of languages work? S-expressions? Forth? JSON? It would have to be able to deal with complex calculations between database columns.
