Reading research papers on how company culture and structure affects code quality ("fault predictors"), it seems it's equally strong in predicting bugs as the messiness of the code itself (long files, big classes, cyclomatic complexity, all that jazz). Yet we as a community does not talk so much about it. Am I right? Maybe because we can't control it? Or because it's not as fun and abstract? Or the knowledge is too new, perhaps?

If it's true that it's equally important for business and customer value, then logically we should give it equal amount of attention.

What's your experience?
