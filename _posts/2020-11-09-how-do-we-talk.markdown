What is "best practices"?

How do we talk about "best practices"?

How do we convince other programmers about what is "good practices"?

Senior could convince another senior, but not a junior.

Pretty vague quality attributes like "readability", "maintainability", "testability", attributes that matter more when a project grows in size and time.

What is a language game? A point of view on language and human interaction. Status is one language game that matters a lot when talking about technology. Different words carry different status.

Appeal to authority, external or internal. "Trust the framework, they know what's idiomatic." Or, "trust me, I have lots of experience, I know what's best."
