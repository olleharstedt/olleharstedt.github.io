title:  Part 2 - Get parser and lexer from Hack work

(Just a mail I send to a friend after I got the parser/lexer to work from Hack.)

Hi!

This:

```ml
[(Ast.Stmt
    (Ast.Expr
       (<opaque>,
        Ast.Binop ((Ast.Eq None), (<opaque>, (Ast.Lvar (<opaque>, "$a"))),
          (<opaque>,
           Ast.Binop (Ast.Plus, (<opaque>, (Ast.Int (<opaque>, "10"))),
             (<opaque>, (Ast.Int (<opaque>, "25")))))))))]
```

is the syntax tree from hacklang for the following code:

```php?start_inline=1
$a = 10 + 25
```

Now we can add our own eval-functions for the nodes in the tree and make our own lint rules! Pretty cool, eh? I'm thinking about adding type-inference to this, and possible remove some of the quirks from PHP, making a safer subset language. We'll see.

Sleep tight! (Or good morning!)

Olle
