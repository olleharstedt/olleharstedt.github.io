Blue are bunnies, red are wolfs (or foxes). They are quickly adapting to an equilibrium (how fast this happen can be tuned).

At `t = 3000`, increase carrying capacity (K) by 2.

At `t = 3000`, start hunting bunnies, but the bunny population recovers, while the wolf population is stable on a lower level. Basically, humans are stealing the food of the wolfes.

At `t = 3000`, start hunting foxes. The bunny population reaches the carrying capacity quickly.
