DRAFT

We need to learn how to talk to radicalized people. Not because they deserve it, but because it's beneficial for _us_, long-term.

There's a lot of talk of social media algorithms reducing trust and increasing radicalization. What's the definition of being radicalized?

Cult?
Anti-rationalism? Anti-science, anti-argumentation.
Blind trust - only one speaks the truth, everyone else lies.
Black-and-white thinking.
Low social trust.
Same as extremism? Where the goal motivates any means.
No regard to human rights?
Violence against outgroup member.

Deradicalisation as a decentralized process.

Bad-faith, good-faith.

LEAP

* Listen without an agenda
* Empathize with any concern they have
* Ask open questions with honest curiosity
* Use the Socratic method when possible

Deep concern and worry about different issues.

Socratic dialogue. Ask open questions in good faith.

Less black-and-white.

First reduce or deactivate safety mode [7], then talk.

> Ther person feels profoundly unsafe. The world is threatening, people have bad intentions, harm seems imminent. [...] worsened by a deep-seated doubt about being able to stop the bad thing from happening. [7, p 124]

Have to first show empathy to reach a problem-solving state-of-mind [6].

> The need for closure is deﬁned as the desire for a quick and ﬁrm answer to a question and the aversion toward ambiguity or uncertainty[8]
> a heightened need for closure gives rise to a syndrome of “group centrism"

Brainwashed - how to know? They call you brainwahsed, and you call them brainwahsed. Are we both brainwashed, because of a never-ending social feedback loop to confirm are biases? Who's willing to investigate those biases, though, and who isn't?
